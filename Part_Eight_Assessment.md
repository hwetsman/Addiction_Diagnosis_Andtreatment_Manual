### Info from Part I and II of the Counselor’s Assessment

Townsend uses a two-part counselor’s assessment. The first part is limited to that information needed to decide if the patient is appropriate for the IOP level of care. The second part is a more in-depth assessment of the illness of addiction and the strengths and challenges the patient brings to treatment. The physician sees the patient after the part II evaluation. Information is provided for the physician from Part I and Part II of the counseling team’s assessment. This is unusual, and the reason for it is explained in detail below. At this point, we’ll just want to go over what some of that information is and how it is important.

One aspect of the assessment concerns current symptom score. You’ll have available to you the admission symptom scores of the patient in both high and low dopamine domains. In addition you’ll have information on which of the symptoms gave trouble before the patient began their use of drugs or alcohol and which compensatory dopamine raising behaviors they engaged in to feel better. This information is very helpful in bringing the patient to the understanding of addiction as an overarching brain illness that is chronic and progressive.

There is also information of the patient’s top three MERs and what symptoms those relieve. In the absence of genetic testing these can give you good information on where in the neurobiology the patient may have a diathesis. You can then aim treatment in a more educated way.

Of course there is much of the usual information, but presented in a way that will help you determine if the patient is a Type I or Type II addict. Also, of course, information will be given to help you determine the social support that the patient has for any treatment you may wish to prescribe.



### Time with patient

Traditionally, addiction medicine has been practiced in the method of psychiatry; that is, the individual practitioner spending an hour or so getting, first hand, all the information from the patient that he needs. This model has been used for over 50 years and has not resulted in any improvements in addiction treatment over that time. Conversely, most other medical care has changed its model of information gathering so that the information is gathered before the doctor and the patient are together. This frees up the encounter time to focus more on treatment planning, patient education and anticipatory guidance. This change, which has allowed a more participatory stance for the patient, has resulted in improved outcomes.

Townsend hopes to maximize the ability of the physician to spend less time confirming important historical points and more time educating about the illness of addiction, the proposed treatment, and giving anticipatory guidance about common missteps. To do this, we have included in our Part I and Part II assessments, done by the patient navigator and counselor, questions of biological and medical import. This allows the physician to have at his fingertips important information even before the patient walks in the room. All that’s left is confirming the information as desired, delving deeper when necessary, completing the examination and making the treatment plan with the patient. This allows the Townsend physician to get much more done in the initial hour than could be done if the physician had to get all the information himself.

We started this technique when I was the only physician, and there were some patients who came to our IOP that didn’t want to see the doctor at all. At the time I believed that when we looked at our outcomes we’d find that those patients that saw me would have greater symptom relief than those that didn’t, but both groups would have the same cognitive progress in treatment because they had the same counselors. It turned out, in a study of our first 114 patients, that symptom scores did not differ between the two groups (p=0.5), but that those that saw me had an average Disease Acceptance Score (DAS) 2 points higher than those who did not (p=.08) that almost reached significance. We repeated the measure with an N of 336. By that point there were other doctors so we divided the groups into those who were exposed to this method and those who did not. Those patients whose doctor used this method had a discharge DAS 2.5 points higher than those who did not (p=.0001).

So this method, when followed, actually improves the outcome of treatment in a way that would not be predicted to have anything to do with the physician. I think that is the case because when the physician is able to spend more time with the patient educating them on the biology of the illness and the necessity for recovery in addition to medication, the patient will accept things that they may have a harder time accepting from a counselor.

Also, anticipatory guidance has a lot to do with patients getting though induction on medication in a stress free and successful way. Many people outside of Townsend have reported difficulties with patients getting on Suboxone for instance. While we have had problems, they have not been numerous. That is because our doctors spend a lot to time prepping the patients for what could happen. These explanations give a reason for the instructions that make sense, when the patient expected rules based on morality or law that they were much less interested in. This is a basic point in dealing with patients with addiction; they will follow rules much better when the rules are explained as being there only for their safety and success.

### Neurocognitive Testing

The neurocognitive testing data from the patient’s admission testing will be available for you during your initial evaluation. It should be documented in the following form:

IGT = $2500

CPT	1000ms	2000ms	4000ms
Tar Acc
Foil Acc
CRT
ERT

It should be considered part of the history as it comes before you saw the patient, however it is best considered like laboratory data, and so should be recorded directly after the examination. If there are previous tests from, for instance, a previous treatment episode, that can be noted.

### Diagnosis

Many times, patients will come to us previously diagnosed with various Axis I disorders in addition to some addiction diagnosis. Most commonly physicians who were not aware of the neurobiology of addiction or the pre- and post-drug symptoms of the illness made these diagnoses. Remember that in the DSM paradigm, any symptoms remaining six months after cessation of using must be caused by some other Axis I illness. This is in direct contradistinction of nature and the natural history of the illness.

While it is always a good idea to keep an open mind about co-occurring disorders, one should remember that the patient has addiction, and Dr Osler’s dictum, “Never add a new diagnosis unless it changes the treatment.” So many of our patients achieve resolution of their life long symptoms, which had been ascribed to this or that other diagnosis, when treated correctly for addiction, that one must have some humility when attempting to make other diagnoses in addicted patients.

The diagnosis is up to the physician, and the physician should remember that the diagnosis is the framework on which the treatment is planned. I personally refrain from guessing about other diagnoses until after treatment unless there is symptomatology that interferes with addiction treatment that is not explained by addiction. For instance, if a patient is having hallucinations that interfere with hearing his counselor or sponsor, there should be treatment. If a patient is too anxious to go to group, there should be some intervention. As long as the intervention isn’t as disabling to addiction treatment as the symptoms, the treatment will be consistent with their Townsend treatment. If the physician decides that the only treatment is disabling to outpatient treatment, then that is an indication that the patient cannot be treated at this level of care.

### Plan

#### Induction

Often a patient will present in withdrawal or with impending withdrawal. As opioid dependence is not uncommon, some discussion of buprenorphine induction is appropriate. Opioid withdrawal and buprenorphine induction are not the only induction we do. It is included here as a representation on the principles that apply across the board.

A physician will evaluate each patient seeking Suboxone in person before receiving a prescription. At the prescribing visit the physician and the patient will decide on a starting time. The starting time will usually be more than 24 hours after the patient’s last short acting opioid, 48 hours after the last “contin”, and 72 hours after the last low dose methadone (<50mg/day). Medical judgment as to starting time will prevail. Also at that visit the physician and patient will decide on the best way to begin induction: at the clinic, at home, etc.

The physician will instruct the patient to take their first dose at the agreed upon time and call the “MD Call Line” in two hours. Two hours is the serum peak of a single dose of Suboxone, so calling sooner will not give good information for titration. The dose will be titrated up on the first day every two hours aiming at complete resolution of symptoms of withdrawal. Once the patient has reached that state, they will stop dosing unless withdrawal symptoms begin again later in the day. The patient will call the MD Call Line for instructions should withdrawal symptoms recur. The physician will complete standing orders for the titration should he decide to accomplish home titration.

For example a patient’s symptoms of withdrawal were 8 out of 10 where 10 is the worst withdrawal he’s ever had and 1 is no withdrawal at all. He starts with a 4mg dose at 8 AM. At 10 AM he calls the Medline and reports that his symptoms are now a 6. He is instructed to take another 4mg and call in two hours. At 12 he calls and says he is fine. He is instructed to stop taking any more unless or until his symptoms return. If they do return he should take 2mg and call the Medline directly after. At 4 PM his symptoms return and he does so. He calls the Medline and is advised to call again in two hours. At 6 PM he is still symptom free. By bedtime he is still comfortable and symptom free. His total 24 hour dose was 10mg, so the Medline instructs him to take 8mg in the AM and 2mg in the afternoon the next day.

Other medications are induced or titrated as well. Again, the physician’s medical judgment prevails. As long as the physician has recorded the appropriate orders and involved the patient in the planning process, the Medline personnel will assist. It should be noted that Townsend does not use benzodiazepines on an outpatient basis for withdrawal. Any physician believing outpatient benzodiazepines are necessary should consult with the Chief Medical Officer.
 
#### Medication Counts

Townsend has mechanisms that we use to help combat diversion in the cases where we have to utilize controlled medications. One of these is the medication count. The medication count is accomplished on a random basis at the physician’s directed frequency. At first this frequency should be 2 to 3 times a week and generally should be the same frequency as the other major anti-diversion mechanism, the MMA. The med count frequency can be lowered when the patient is stable, has a long-term recovery program, and has fewer risk factors for diversion. An incomplete list of risk factors for diversion or misuse are: symptom score > 20, missing sessions, lack of cognitive advance, disruptive home life, no stable relationship with recovery community, medication irregularities, and positive MMA results.

In general the medication count is done when the patient arrives for their scheduled appointment or group. The patient accomplishes the med count himself. At no time will Townsend personnel touch a patient’s controlled medication, and neither should you. The med count is witnessed by Townsend personnel, but counted by the patient.

The med count can seem to be a useless waste of effort at first, but it is a major disruptor of the economics of diversion. And diversion is primarily an economic matter. It is not often that a patient with addiction would choose to give up a medication that works for him, however people claiming to have addiction in order to get prescriptions for Suboxone occasionally will try to scam us. Use of a sophisticated MMA process and medication counts greatly cuts this risk.

There are also occasions when a patient has not yet reached stability when they undervalue their medication because they have not yet experienced the long-term benefits of it. Such a patient is at greater risk of diversion if some shorter-term solution is offered. The presence of medication counts and sophisticated MMAs can help fence in the behavioral aspects of the illness until the patient can be stabilized and make cognitive progress.

#### MMA and Labs

Townsend does not practice medicine, you do. We will not tell you what labs to order or at what frequency. There are some things, however I feel it is important to know when deciding on the frequency and type of monitoring for the patient with addiction.

I was one who felt that lab monitoring was not necessary generally. I thought that I would be able to tell if a person was using substances from the quality of their recovery. Experience taught me that I was wrong. When I practiced in a setting where others decided on labs, I found that my personal predictions on who was and who wasn’t using were incorrect. In retrospect, it should have been obvious to me that I could no more predict the results of a lab test for someone with addiction than I could predict the results of a blood glucose test in someone with diabetes.

Many in our field use the term “drug screen.” We do not. We used to use “drug screens,” those CLIA waived cups that most treatment centers used. However in a study we did in 2011 with a laboratory partner, we discovered that the best CLIA waived cups we could get missed a significant amount of the positives as seen in the table below. Evidently, more sophisticated testing is necessary.


|Class	| Confirmed Positives |	False Negative |	% Positives Missed |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
|Opiates|	54|	17|	31.5%|
|Oxycodone|	32|	6|	18.8%|
|Methadone|	8|	2|	25%|
|Benzos	|83	|17	|20.5%|
|Amphet	|63	|8	|12.7%|
|Cocaine|	25|	6|	24%|
|Cannabis|	48|	2|	4.2%|

I’ve learned a lot in treating addiction over two decades, and with respect to laboratory monitoring for drug usage, I’ve distilled my thoughts into a blog article I first wrote in July of 2011 when we had just gotten this information.  I’m appending it here:


 
### What an Addiction Physician Wants From a Lab

“If you see addiction as an illness, and you want a monitoring system in place to make sure that the illness is contained as part of a larger treatment program, you probably want better drug testing than you have.
There are several questions to ask:
1. How often to test
2. What to test for
3. What method to use for screening
4. When to confirm and what to confirm for
But there is a larger question that underlies all of these and is the reason that any testing is done at all. That question is, “Has the patient used any substances since the last test?” We want to know if the patient is abstinent, if the usage, and that part of the illness, has been contained. We want to know that because there are certain parts of treatment that are appropriate for someone who is abstinent that are a waste of time if they aren’t. And there are certain interventions that are important if someone isn’t abstinent that are not only a waste of time, but actually hurtful, if the patient is.
So we really don’t want to know positive or negative answers unless they answer the larger question. A positive on a point of care (POC) cup for THC isn’t important unless it answers the question of whether or not the patient used since last tested. I’ve never seen a lab that actually caters to treaters of addiction in order to be able to give us a fast, accurate, reasoned answer to the big question. And when you think about it, it’s not a question a lab is designed to answer.
They want to answer the little questions, “Did he have more than 50ng of THC per ml in the sample you put in the cup?” or “How many ng of THC per ml was in the sample you sent?” A lab is a technical place and they want to answer technical questions. But clinicians don’t treat test tubes and we want answers that are important to the treatment we’re doing.
In a perfect world, we would test everyone everyday with a perfect confirmation analyzer we had in the clinic and get immediate and perfectly accurate results immediately. Oh, and it would be free also. So much for a perfect world.
So what we have now is a set of compromises because of the inability to get to that perfect goal and we come up with different compromises based on our setting (clinic, doctor’s office, inpatient, forensic, etc), the cost, our need for accuracy, our or our patients’ ability to pay, and our ability to wait. So before we can answer those four questions above we need to know these important factors.
I’ll give you my factors, but they are just mine. Yours will be different if you work in a different setting. My patients largely have insurance so can pay for testing. They are in an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) so they are seen frequently. They have jobs and resources so that they can afford drugs and have the freedom to go get them in between sessions if the disease is not contained. They may be on medications that need to be monitored to be sure the patient is taking them correctly. We track our patients’ progress through treatment with a numerical system so that we know what intervention to do when, so it’s important for us to know on a daily basis that the disease is contained or not; therefore we need the answers fast. Our goal is to prevent more expensive inpatient admissions so, some added cost for drug testing is acceptable. We need accurate answers on not only drug levels but corrected drug levels for state of hydration so that we can see if someone’s level is falling or rising.
So here’s what we’ve come up with. Because we need answers fast we use POC testing for as many things as we can. It’s not very accurate so we have to confirm our positive results. The problem is that the negatives aren’t always accurate either (especially for methadone, opiates, and benzos) so if we’re suspicious we have to send the entire panel off for confirmation. We’d love to confirm every test everyday, but can’t because of cost so we only do negatives when we’re suspicious. We test three times a week at first, though we’d like to test everyday but the cost is prohibitive, and lower to twice a week and then weekly as the patient stabilizes. If there is a positive we go back to three times a week and taper according to the person’s stability. We confirm our POC testing for the entire panel one time at first (to ensure that negatives are really negatives before using POC routinely) and then for suspicion, because we’ve had cases where people have been using something that POC testing can’t test for (like Z drugs or Soma). If on first test we find something like that we follow with lowest level of testing available to monitor for that. When we send things to the lab we always get validity testing to measure an accurate creatinine. That’s for comparing inter-test levels of drugs. For instance if we test someone a second time and the level went up, does it mean they used or are dehydrated the second time? With creatinine corrected values we can tell.
What I want is to find a lab that will come and pick up my samples after group and drive them overnight to the lab so that they can be tested first thing in the AM. I want the answer to the question before I see the patient again the next day. Otherwise I won’t be able to do the best intervention the next day. I want the lab to do the testing with accurate measures so we don’t need to keep confirming negatives and only confirm positives. I want that right away as well. This is going to cost, but it will save in other ways. Because I get the answer fast, treatment will go better and faster. I understand that in other treatment programs that say the same thing to each person everyday, it doesn’t matter, but to us it does. If I don’t have to use POC for fast results I can skip that step and use more accurate screening with the lab’s machine, thereby saving the necessity for confirming negatives. And when I get the answer from the lab, I want the answer to my question, not the answer to theirs.
Will I get that? Maybe one day. There’s a big shake up in our space because of parity, a new biological view of addiction, a more medically managed approach. We probably need to start from the bottom up because most labs available to us now started as monitors for pain management programs. Insurance companies have to start seeing their whole cost of the illness rather than looking only at treatment. Society has to embrace this illness as an illness rather than something blameworthy so the emphasis can leave “catching” and go to monitoring. We’ll need better informatics so that we can take advantage of the improved information flow and it will result in better treatment. I think we have a better treatment program, but currently our drug testing is holding us back. Others are probably holding back from improving treatment because the drug testing to support it isn’t available. Hopefully, that will change soon.”
DATA
Since writing this we have switched primary lab providers and found one that is willing to work toward our goals. They send a courier to each of our clinics every night after group and bring the samples to their lab for processing. They get the screenings done in the early AM and confirm the positives so that we have confirmed, creatinine adjusted, MRO interpreted results to our staff before group the next day. In 2011, before we started using this lab, 75% of our final samples were counted as abstinent. That is, if someone left treatment abstinent after completing, their last sample was abstinent. If they abandoned treatment and were using, their last sample was not. In 2012, since we started using the lab, the abstinence rate of our final samples increased to 87% (N=1142, p<.0001). That’s a 16% improvement in successful outcomes just from changing to the new lab. We feel this is because we are using more accurate data faster to get better results in treatment.
