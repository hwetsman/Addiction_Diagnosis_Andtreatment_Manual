### The Clinical Staff

The staffing in a traditional IOP is a counselor, a part time medical director,
and a person at the desk. There may be one other person but not more than that
for a one group IOP.  The counselor has many roles; they are the group
facilitation, case management, recovery coaching, intake, attracting referrals,
and senior clinician who is over all responsible. That sounds like a lot, and it
is. In practice one person can play all those roles, but if they do, they can
manage about six patients. Because the goal of the ADAM way is to democratize
addiction treatment and get as many people treated as possible, the choice would
seem to be either to limit the group to six patients or not do such a good job.
We chose another path.

The treatment center uses a counseling team, as really no one person can be all
things to all patients. The team consists of a group facilitator for each group,
a single case manager covering both groups, a senior clinician covering both
groups and who often functions as the recovery coach, and a patient navigator to
handle assessments and intake or referral.

The group facilitator role is the most straight forward in the context of legacy addiction treatment. The group facilitators are primarily responsible for engaging the patient in treatment and consequently for patient attendance, providing the psycho-educational component of treatment, facilitating the group therapy component of treatment and documenting the care. They are also the person who will probably do the patient’s Part II evaluation though the senior clinician may do this.

The case manager, while often seen as a junior position compared to the group facilitator, is, at the treatment center using ADAM, the most important person on the team. The case manger is responsible for making sure we and the patient are adhering to the system of care and that the patient is making milestones and informing the team of this. The system of care includes medical monitoring for adherence (which we call MMAs), medication counts, neurocognitive testing and other testing. The case manager is the communication lynchpin of the team.

The senior clinician is an overall supervisor of the counseling staff and has the primary responsibility to move the patient through the Disease Acceptance Scale with the use of ADAM’s interventions usually given in an individual format. They also serve to back up a team member who is on vacation or ill.

The recovery coach engages the patient in the here and now in order to disengage the patient from reliance on treatment and to engage the patient in participation in a recovery community. Because of the intense bonds created in group therapy, we find it is difficult for even experienced counselors to handle the transition without the outside recovery coach. The member of the team may not be a professional and may be a peer support person.

The navigator may also not be a clinical professional. The navigator is responsible for doing the Part I evaluation and helping the patient navigate the system of admission or referral to the level of care most appropriate for them. They take warm handoffs from our call center to help get the inquiring person to come in or bring their loved one for an assessment. The navigator does the assessment and uses Townsend’s standards and consultation with the clinical team to provide the patient with a recommendation regarding level of care.

The team meets every day for a huddle that is done standing up. The huddle serves the purpose of allowing each team member to communicate to the rest what they have scheduled, any challenges they have with scheduling and any help they need. The huddle is run by the clinic manager who may be the same person as the senior clinician. The huddle is conducted standing up as it is meant to be a brief check-in.

Formal staffing is conducted once a week with the presence of the medical director and the entire team. Usually, staffing is done for one hour per group and is focused on whether each patient is making adequate progress both in symptom reduction and in improvement of Disease Acceptance Score (DAS), which we’ll discuss later. Most of the time is spent with the team identifying barriers to improvement in those patients not progressing according to plan.

### The MD Call Line

The treatment center using ADAM has a centrally located nursing call center to aid the doctors and patients in the medically intensive portions of our treatment. The nurses carry out the doctor’s orders for titration of medications and contact the patient’s doctor or doctor on call for clarifications when necessary. They also field calls from patients about medication questions, save the doctors time by calling pharmacies and insurance companies for prior authorizations, and handle other administrative duties needed in medical care.
