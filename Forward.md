Long before the APA’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)[^1], long before America forgot that addiction is a disease, long before ASAM, long before prohibition and AA, there was a specialty of Addiction Medicine. Physicians who were well respected practiced it; it had its own journal[^2]. Treatment centers were set up to treat the illness[^3].

These physicians didn’t have the resources or the science we have today, but they had something we didn’t. They had a blank canvas, unmarred by preconceived ideas. They had their observations and they didn’t have to edit those to match what was expected by the academic powers that be. They watched the illness in its natural form, and they respected its power. They didn’t try to pretend it was something less than it was, an act of nature.

They took their observations and devised treatments based on those. Unlike most of today’s addiction specialists they did not have a primary mental health background, perhaps because there was not much in the way of organized psychiatry yet. So their observations and their treatments were aimed at a physical illness called by several names such as Addiction, Alcoholism, and Inebriety. But by whatever name they called it, they did not use the name to pretend that the thing had no power. They saw it as physical illness.

The social change that occurred in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries led to a different view of addiction. A discussion of the anthropology and sociology of how that change came about is interesting but is beyond the scope of this book. Suffice it to say that by 1920, America, and Addiction Medicine, was entirely different.

No longer was addiction an illness that occurred in nature; it was the consequence of willful behavior. No longer was treatment seen as necessary; what was necessary was a moral change. No longer could a physician use medication, beyond withdrawal medications, to help a patient. As addiction was no longer an illness, the AMA stated that the treatment of the person with addiction was no longer within the purview of the physician. The laws changed. Expectations changed. Generations of physicians came and went having never learned the knowledge of their distant predecessors.

But since that time we have had the reintroduction of Addiction Medicine, the formation of ASAM and now board certification. We’ve had Olds and Milner[^4]; we’ve had DiChiara[^5]. We’ve had the “Decade of the Brain[^6].” We’ve had multiple new medications introduced to help people with addiction. We’ve had the Human Genome Project[^7]. We know more about the neurobiology of addiction than we do any other behavioral brain based disorder.

Still, more important than what we’ve gained is, I think, what we’ve lost. We’ve lost our last excuse to not treat addicted people like patients with a chronic incurable biological illness.

We know what those doctors in the nineteenth century could not have known. We have the tools they could not have had. We have a wealthier country than they could know. We have greater ability to communicate with each other and our patients than they could have imagined.

We have a more heterogeneous society than that of the early twentieth century. We don’t have as many of the social prejudices that then existed. We don’t have the proprietary blinders they were proud of.

So unlike the physicians of the nineteenth or early twentieth centuries, we have no excuse. There is no longer any reason for any person to die of addiction. It is a treatable chronic illness, though while left untreated it is progressive and fatal. Every death from addiction can be laid now at the feet of those who would cling to the ignorance of the past, be they patient, family, doctor, organization or society. The hope of this book is that, soon, there will be no more unwilling sacrifices lying at those feet. And hopefully you will be part of the revolution that brings that about.
