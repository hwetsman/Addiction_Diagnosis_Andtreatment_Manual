Basic Principles of Addiction Medicine the Townsend Way

To not use benzodiazepines to affect GABAb.

To understand why the patient uses what he uses, not just what he uses.

To use the longest acting, most tonic medication when raising dopamine tone and not substances that work fast but only for a short period of time.

That the physician be a primary advocate for the patient’s entering a recovery lifestyle.

To advocate for patients to stay on their medication until they have the maximum opportunity for success off of the medication.

To intervene medically, psychologically, or educationally at any point in the addicted patient’s lifecycle when interventions are necessary regardless of how many years the patient has in recovery.

To advocate for abstinence from all rewards that cause supra-physiologic spikes for the patient and to help the patient gain the dopamine tone they need to not crave or seek any such reward.

To treat cue induced craving after normalizing dopamine tone, even if no obvious cues are reported, if there is continued use or craving.

To try not to use SSRI medications in type II addiction, and when forced to, to monitor closely for decreases in dopamine release.

To use the upstream to downstream understanding of the dopamine cascade when raising dopamine tone.

That addiction is a single illness and that no medicine is better or worse because of how it works.

To use medication to foster recovery and growth of spirit, not as a substitute for that growth.

To understand what would have been an Axis II personality disorder diagnosis as the earliest “drug” in the patient’s repertoire and not to label people with Axis II as an expression of their lack of response to treatment.

To not merely treat the symptom but find and resolve the underlying disorder.
