### Medications used in addiction

**GABA Receptor Agents**: There are three reasons for using a medicine that
turns on the GABA receptors. They are distinguished by the receptors they
affect. Agents that are useful in medical withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives
must agonize both the GABA<sub>a</sub> and the GABA<sub>b</sub> receptor. While benzodiazepines do
this, they are generally not appropriate in the outpatient treatment of
addiction because they can be rewarding and lead to compulsive use if
unsupervised. Other medications that are agonists at both GABA receptors are the
“Anti-epileptic Drugs” also known as AEDs. These are medications such as
valproic acid and carbamazepine that are both rapidly titrated, affect both
GABA<sub>a</sub> and GABA<sub>b</sub> and are useful in sedative hypnotic withdrawal. Other AEDs are
slower to titrate and less useful in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms.

A reason other than withdrawal management to use an agent that acts positively
at a GABA receptor is to use one that specifically agonizes GABAsub>b</sub> primarily.
Under the influence of GABAsub>b</sub> the dopamine spike from a drug is not as high and
the resulting crash is not as low. It can help someone who is trying to stop
using from using as much as they had been. There’s no guarantee with it, but it
can be a useful technique. The AEDs are good for this GABAsub>b</sub> effect as well as an
old muscle relaxant called baclofen. We don’t need to use this as much as we
used to, now that acamprosate is available in this country (see glutamate agents
below).

The final reason to use GABA agents in addiction treatment is to treat
underlying anxiety in Type I patients. The AEDs are good for this, and any can
be used. The primary considerations are time to titration and med-med
interactions. Benzodiazepines are generally not appropriate medications for the
treatment of anxiety disorders in people with addiction.

**Dopamine Agents**: We can affect dopamine tone by increasing the amount of
dopamine at the receptor. This can be done by increasing the amount of dopamine
produced, the amount of dopamine released or decreasing the reuptake or
degradation of dopamine in the synapse. For increasing the amount produced, in
those patients who are genetically affected by MTHFR mutation we use
L-methylfolate. For those with decreased dopamine release we could use either
buprenorphine, selegiline, or Chantix depending on why the patient had decreased
release. If both production and release is thought to be appropriate, we can use
bupropion to increase the amount by decreasing reuptake. There is suggestion
that an herbal supplement, Rhodiola Rosia, can decrease COMT degradation of
dopamine.

There are two problematic medications that have been used to raise dopamine in
people with addiction. The first is amphetamines, and the second is a drug
called modafinil. Amphetamines are potentially dangerous because they don’t just
block the reuptake of dopamine, they run the reuptake pump in reverse. This
produces a situation where the patient and doctor are forced to choose between
two equally abhorrent long-term possibilities: that the patient have a daily
crash to restore dopamine reuptake (which will raise risk of returning to
compulsive use) and risk a chronic dose escalation with no drug holiday (which
could lead to an untreatable condition in several years with depletion of
dopamine stores). I didn't use amphetamines in patients with addiction. At first
it was thought that modafinil worked like bupropion, and only blocked the
reuptake of dopamine. But reports suggest that, at least in some patients, it
acts more like an amphetamine. Until we can determine, perhaps genetically, who
can and can’t take modafinil safely, its use should only be undertaken with the
most cautious care.

**Glutamate Modulators**: Acamprosate works to block the glutamate-triggered
craving that comes in response to sensory cues that remind the patient of
previous drug use. The glutamate signal is normally released in the reward
center and serves to get the compulsive use cycle spinning. Because each
dopamine spike is followed by a crash, this spinning leads to the craving one
normally feels during the dopamine crash. With acamprosate blocking the
glutamate signal, the reward circuit doesn’t spin up as much, and there is less
chance of craving.

We’ve also noticed that it helps with what we used to call “denial” and now
call “pre-thought level of disease acceptance.” (More on the stages of disease
acceptance in a later section.) I think the denial is caused by an overflow of
the brain’s opioids into the area that remembers emotions, and under the
influence of this overflow the person cannot remember how bad it was to use. As
the acamprosate tunes down the glutamate signal, the reward system doesn’t get
spun up. So, instead of the brain’s opioids flooding the area and causing
“denial,” acamprosate keeps the opioid flood from happening. It’s been very
helpful and low in side effects.

Since using acamprosate, I have not had the need to use a GABA<sub>b</sub> agents
much other than for withdrawal. The GABA<sub>b</sub> effect must have been lowering
glutamate but maybe not as directly because acamprosate seems to work better
than the AEDs on the issue of denial.

**Opioid Receptor Agents**: A lot of doctors block the opioid receptor, which
makes sense if you want to stop drug use. It doesn’t make as much sense if
you’re treating what was wrong with the person before they started using drugs
to feel better. The medication to block the opiate receptor is called naltrexone,
and it has recently been released as a once a month shot for people who have had
trouble maintaining abstinence. Hopefully, we will soon have genetic markers for
who needs buprenorphine and who can safely take naltrexone over the long term.

### From Methadone to Suboxone

Methadone, because of its high affinity for the mu receptor, its long half-life, and it’s deep deposition into tissue, poses a special problem when inducing buprenorphine treatment. The “common wisdom” taught in the eight-hour buprenorphine training generally provides an insufficient model to successfully transfer most methadone patients to Suboxone. As a result, it has become a common thinking that there are many people who cannot make the transition and “need methadone.” This section will give you background on why the typical method doesn’t work and alternative methods that do. It will also discuss a few problems that accompany Suboxone induction and early treatment after methadone.

The common method of moving someone from methadone to Suboxone involves tapering their methadone down to 30 to 40mg, stopping there, waiting 72 hours while maintaining the person’s withdrawal symptoms, and then beginning Suboxone induction. It is suggested to use 2mg test doses in case induction is premature and precipitated withdrawal is induced. For someone who is not taking much more than 40mg of methadone a day this method is sufficient, however most patients admitting to treatment take more, perhaps much more, methadone a day.

Why it won’t work in most cases is something that is readily apparent if one views addiction as a chronic illness. If, as I believe, using is brought on by symptoms of addiction, then tapering methadone slowly, while not resulting in much withdrawal, will result in increased symptoms of addiction, the very symptoms that started the use in the first place. I have never successfully tapered someone from over 80mg to 40mg in an unregulated outpatient setting. The taper required is so slow and the misery of symptoms is so great that they cannot last the time without using.

What to do instead is perhaps not intuitive. If the patient cannot remain adherent to a slow taper down to 40mg of methadone, the primary alternative is to stop methadone immediately and entirely. This will of course put the patient into opioid withdrawal at a time when they cannot be induced on Suboxone. The withdrawal requires treatment by other means. There are two other means.

Non-opioid treatment of opioid withdrawal is what all of us did before Suboxone. Clonidine to block the adrenergic spike, baclofen or xanaflex for spasms, antihistamines for sedation if necessary and Imodium for diarrhea are helpful here. The patient will require frequent check-ins with your office staff, and you’ll want to be in touch daily with them.

Treating only for pain is another option though some feel uncomfortable with it. In this method the patient is withdrawn from methadone without any medical help at all. If they are asymptomatic, one does nothing. If they complain of pain, one can choose to treat their pain with a long half-life opioid pain reliever such as Oxycontin. It should be noted that, as the patient is opioid dependent, the prescriber in this case would want to note that he is treating acute pain in an opioid dependent person and is taking certain specific actions to avoid abuse and diversion of the medication. In this case the treatment may be that the prescriptions are called in daily or twice a day at your preference. They may be taken at home or in your office at your preference. But it is important to remain a prescriber not distributor, so you and your staff should never hold or keep a patient’s medication for them. The patient can be treated for 72 hours with a long-acting opioid and then switched to a short acting opioid if treatment is still needed for pain. If further treatment is not needed the patient can usually be induced onto Suboxone 48 hours after the last Oxycontin; if further treatment with a short acting agent such as oxycodone is needed it can be continued for three days under similar regimen. Once you have determined that the acute pain problem is resolved you can stop the oxycodone and induce Suboxone after 24 hours for addiction treatment.

Special problems:

Methadone is long lasting in the body because of its long half-life and its deposition and slow leaching from tissues. It has a high affinity for the mu receptor. If Suboxone coverage of the mu receptor falls between doses during induction or even during the first month or more with high dose methadone patients, methadone can find its way back onto the receptor so that the patient experiences a bit of withdrawal with each dose of Suboxone. It is therefore imperative that the patient’s Suboxone dose and dosing frequency be sufficient to give 24/7 complete coverage to the mu receptor. It is my experience that the typical dosing regimen taught in the 8-hour course is usually insufficient, which explains why so few patients are successfully transferred from methadone to Suboxone.

Suboxone is hard to self-administer, as it requires a specific technique rather than just swallowing. If the patient stops using the proper technique the effective dose will fall and, perhaps, mu receptor coverage will fall, leading to precipitated withdrawal with the next dose as noted above.

Consultation is often required, and many practitioners are afraid to attempt outpatient transition from methadone to Suboxone. Should you have any questions, seek consultation with someone experienced in these methods.

### Bupropion

Suboxone was not the first addition wonder drug. Long before Suboxone became available I found great use from bupropion (Wellbutrin). Bupropion is a dopamine and nor-epinephrine reuptake blocker. Our primary interest in it is to block the reuptake of dopamine at the DAT and increase the amount of dopamine in the synapse of the VTA/NA. Of course, we can’t limit the actions of bupropion to that area, so we’ll be raising dopamine levels throughout the brain.

The effect of bupropion is immediate. As soon as it gets to the brain it blocks the DAT and, in the appropriate patient, dopamine level starts to rise. When the patient needs bupropion, and you get to the appropriate dose symptom release will be that day or the next. This is, of course, in contrast to its effect as an anti-depressant. As you know, Major Depression is a biological illness that results in symptomatology by the loss of neuronal interconnectedness due to decreased neurogenesis. When bupropion or any anti-depressant is given for Major Depression, it acts at the cortisol receptor to block cortisol, reversing the chronic stress signal, restarting the production of BDNF and reinstituting neurogenesis. The BDNF must then travel down to the axonal terminal, restart axonal growth, and the axon has to grow back to make the connection that was lost. This regrowth process is what takes 6-8 weeks for an anti-depressant to work and is not of primary interest to us in addiction medicine.

For our purposes, bupropion will work in three different types of patients: those with a hyperactive DAT, those with a hyperactive COMT, those with low density or low function of dopamine receptors or downstream messengers. Because of its action it will not work, in general, on people who don’t make enough dopamine or people who don’t release enough dopamine. In addition, because bupropion works throughout the brain, special care will be needed with those patients with addiction who are genetically Type I.

	Hyperactive DAT:  This case is clear-cut. The DAT is hyperactive, and we are blocking it with bupropion. When we do, dopamine level will rise in the synapse.

	Hyperactive COMT: This is a case of indirect effect. As the DAT is not the problem in this patient the action of bupropion, while perhaps useful, won’t be the best long-term solution. However, we may not know about the COMT effect at the time of prescription of bupropion. When we block DAT dopamine tone will rise, but because COMT is hyperactive we are just giving it more dopamine to chew. This will work, but it will be indirect. If we find later that this person has hyperactive COMT, we may wish to switch to a medication or supplement that blocks COMT.

	Low DR density, low DR function, or downstream signaling problem: Again, this is a case of indirect effect, however there are no more direct treatments currently available. Bupropion is useful here to raise the level of dopamine at the receptor so that more signal can get through.

	Insufficient dopamine production: If we don’t make enough dopamine, we can’t release enough dopamine, and if we can’t release enough dopamine, blockade of the DAT will not result in as sufficient a rise in dopamine level. As you know, the only factor we can currently reverse in dopamine production is that related to MTHFR. While MTHFR problems exist in around 25-30% of the population, you’ll note that the addicted population has a much higher rate of MTHFR problems. Luckily, we have Deplin for these patients. Once on Deplin, if these patients need bupropion, it should work, but only after Deplin.

Don’t release enough dopamine: The reasoning is as above, but here the problem isn’t dopamine production. If someone has poor dopamine release because of a mu receptor polymorphism we can use Suboxone. If they have poor dopamine release because of a nicotine receptor problem we can use Chantix. Sometimes when people are on bupropion and we start either of these medications they find they have too much dopamine, and in this case, we’d remove bupropion, the downstream medication.

Cautions on people with hyperactive MAOb: Patients with hyperactive MAOb will breakdown dopamine after reuptake before it can be safely packaged into vesicles. If such a patient is put on bupropion, the effect is intensified because reuptake is slower and presentation of dopamine at the enzyme will be slower and more effective. These are people who make experience a resumption of symptoms after initial relief of symptoms with bupropion. They would be better to be treated with a specific MAOb inhibitor unless contraindicated.

Cautions on genetic Type I’s: People who genetically have high dopamine and anxious symptoms will begin to use sedatives to cope. While these sedatives are helpful at first, each time the alcohol or sedative causes a midbrain dopamine reward spike there is some increased loss of VTA cells. This can lead, over time, to their development of addiction by loss of midbrain dopamine tone. When they present to treatment for addiction they pose a special problem, because we must cover for the high dopamine symptoms first before raising dopamine in the midbrain. That can be done with either an SSRI to lower dopamine release or a GABAb agent to decrease the dopamine spike. Some precaution should be taken in these people before starting bupropion, even if bupropion is indicated, or else they will likely have an increase in anxiety and be unable to tolerate the bupropion.

In dosing bupropion, we must first be aware of the many forms in which it comes. Wellbutrin (immediate release) peaks in one hour and would have to be taken three times a day to achieve a steady state. However, this rapid peaking is associated with four times the seizure risk of SSRI’s and SHOULD NEVER BE USED IN CLINICAL CASES. Wellbutrin SR is a form that peaks in three hours and is marketed for bid use. In some people it can be used bid, but some cannot get an even steady state without using SR three times a day. It has the same seizure risk as an SSRI and is generally safe to use. Wellbutrin XL peaks in five hours and is marketed as once a day. Very rarely will someone be able to take once a day dosing of XL, and then only at the lowest dose. Generally, it’s a twice a day medication. Aplenzin is a form of bupropion bromide instead of bupropion chloride. They say it is longer lasting, but it has about the same pharmacokinetic profile of XL.

The dose of bupropion must be titrated and cannot be guessed ahead of time. It is best to start with 150mg of the XL in the morning for three days. If the patient is not well in three days, we add 150mg at bedtime. (It is important to note that the dose is given at bedtime not in the evening. As the peaking is not for five hours, if we take it at bedtime, we go to sleep, and it rises while the patient is asleep. If the patient takes it at 8 and tries to go to sleep three hours later the rising level may prevent sleep.) If the patient is not well three days after starting bid, the morning dose is raised to 300mg. I have rarely had to go to 300mg of Wellbutrin XL bid, and only in very large people. It is noted that this is a much faster titration than is taught for bupropion as an anti-depressant. Generally addicted patients know how to feel better fast and if we delay the effect of a medication by titrating for an illness that takes 6 weeks for neurons to grow, we’ll lose the patient.

It is important to note that the sustained effect of most bupropion preparations is based on pill integrity. NEVER COUNSEL A PATIENT OR ALLOW A PATIENT TO CUT OR BREAK PILLS WHEN TAKING BUPROPION. Breaking pills could essentially put them in a 1-hour peaking scenario and increase seizure risk.

When it is necessary to stop bupropion or the patient can come off of bupropion, there can be a mild “crash,” but there is generally no significant withdrawal. Most patients can be immediately stopped, but if there is time, patient satisfaction will be aided by withdrawing bupropion at the same rate we titrated it.

Miscellaneous Problems:

“Wellbutrin never worked for me”
	This is heard generally from patients who need Deplin or some medication to increase dopamine release. They can be assuaged with explanations of the biology and will be confident that you know what you’re talking about when they see the effects when used again, after the appropriate medication is in place.

“Wellbutrin made me irritable”
	And it may have. This is heard from some people who shouldn’t be on bupropion, people with normal or high dopamine. They can be made to be irritable with too much dopamine. However, there is a group of patients who benefit from bupropion who will say this same thing. Most physicians don’t dose Wellbutrin correctly and when dosed once a day the patients will get irritable when the level is falling later in the day. Ask these patients when they got irritable. Was it in the AM within the five hours after the dose or later in the PM? Most will say it was in the PM. If so then you can assure them that they were not made irritable by the Wellbutrin, but rather by the Wellbutrin going away. This is good news as it means they were feeling better when they had a good Wellbutrin level, and it will work when dosed correctly. If someone says they were irritable 3 hours to 6 hours after taking it, then it was the medication making them irritable.

“I’m bulimic”
	Well, frankly, this one scares most people to death, or at least scares them to the point where they won’t use Wellbutrin. But we must understand why there is a contraindication to use in bulimia.
	Back before SSRIs hit the market Wellbutrin was developed. It was ready to go, approved for use in depression. The makers noted in the studies that not only did depression get better, but “obsessive compulsive” behaviors such as smoking, overeating, gambling, and drinking got better as well. Trying to make more money, they decided to do a study to treat an “obsessive compulsive” behavior. It was the 80’s and Karen Carpenter was dying of bulimia, so they tried that. It worked too. Because bulimics are compulsive overeaters who purge, and because compulsive overeating is a dopamine reward-based behavior in addiction, some of the patients responded to Wellbutrin. There were two problems. The first was that they were using immediate release Wellbutrin with its increased risk of seizure. The second was that they used practicing bulimics who were throwing up several times a day who consequently had disturbed electrolytes. There was, of course, and increased prevalence of seizures in this study. The drug was pulled, and more studies were done. I often wonder if they hadn’t been greedy, would we have twelve dopamine reuptake inhibitors and Prozac instead of twelve SSRIs and Wellbutrin.
	In any case there has never been to my knowledge any study of non-active bulimics who had increased risk of seizure with Wellbutrin. In fact, since relapse into purging is started by compulsive overeating, and overeating can be decreased with bupropion; one might consider that the risk is actually lower.

“I’m an still drinking alcoholic”
	It’s odd to think that there’s a warning on Wellbutrin about giving it to drinking alcoholics. Turns out that if you do, they can suddenly stop drinking and have withdrawal seizures. To us that’s less of a warning than an advertisement. The key here is to cover withdrawal and prevent seizures. If bupropion is indicated the physician and patient must do a risk/benefit analysis and make a joint decision on how to proceed.

“I’ve had a seizure in the past”
	If you treat addiction, you’ll meet lots of people who have had a seizure. Too much cocaine, too much amphetamine, too little alcohol are all precursors of the odd seizure. While any seizure is to be avoided. The simple fact that the person has had a seizure in the past must be viewed in the context of the complete illness. Again, the patient and doctor need to do a joint risk/benefit decision on how to proceed.

“I’m on Effexor”
	I’ve never had much luck adding Wellbutrin to Effexor or any other SNRI. Wellbutrin increases both dopamine and norepinephrine so the two medications both blocking NE reuptake can be a bit much. Also, bupropion blocks the metabolism of Effexor and therefore raises its blood level. If someone has “SSRI poop-out” from Effexor and you give them Wellbutrin, the Effexor level rises and they feel worse, blaming the Wellbutrin. I’ve had more luck switching to another SSRI without NE reuptake blockade and then starting the Wellbutrin.

“I’m on a MAOI”
	It is clearly contraindicated to take bupropion while taking an MAOI.

“Wellbutrin is giving me insomnia”
	There are two basic forms of not sleeping patients complain of: inability to go to sleep and inability to stay asleep. The inability to stay asleep is a low dopamine phenomenon. When our dopamine tone is lowered, we aren’t designed to sleep soundly. Low dopamine tone is part of the starvation signal, and in a famine, it would be counterproductive to sleep soundly. You might come in and steal my food, or I might miss the noise of game passing by. When patients complain of this on bupropion, it should be considered that they are not taking enough to keep the level high enough at night to prevent this low dopamine dip from waking them up.
	If someone is complaining of not falling asleep, and there aren’t many people with addiction that don’t complain of that, it should be remembered that there IS NO SAFE CHRONIC SLEEP AID IN ADDICTION. The primary reason people with addiction are not able to fall asleep is that there are still many thoughts in their mind on which they have not done step work during the day. So rather than see the inability to go to sleep as a problem of the night, it is most properly seen as a problem of the entire day. It is best to direct the patient back to their recovery for the solution to this problem. If the problem starts only when they are on bupropion, consider changing the time of the second dose or lowering the dose.

“Wellbutrin is making me irritable”
	Like the insomnia from lowered dopamine tone, when people are taking incorrectly dosed Wellbutrin, they sometimes experience a crash during the afternoon. It should be remembered that it is a basic principle of addiction medicine to avoid crashes wherever possible.
	When patients present with this complaint, I ask when is it making them irritable. Is it during the late morning, three to five hours after the dose? Or is it between 2 and 5PM when they are crashing. If it is during the crash, the answer is to add another dose to the AM so that the load will be spread across the day. If they are getting irritable from the Wellbutrin peak it is necessary to consider if it is from DA or NE. If from NE, alpha two agonists can be employed if not contraindicated. If you feel it’s from DA, consider a GABAb agent or SSRI to blunt the effect, or even whether Wellbutrin is the correct medication for the patient.

“I have a high dopamine spike”
	Obviously, patients don’t use these words, but if you some evidence to believe that the patient has a higher-than-normal dopamine spike, you’ll want to blunt that spike with a GABAb agent before starting Wellbutrin. If we don’t, the increased spike will just increase the reward signal from rewarding behaviors and agents and make it difficult for the patient to stop the behavior.

### Sedative Hypnotic Withdrawal

Sedative Hypnotics include anything that can down-regulate the GABA receptors including alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, “Z-drugs”, and others. Sedative-hypnotic withdrawal is dangerous in that seizures and death are possible outcomes. As this document is concerned only with sedative-hypnotic withdrawal I will refer to it as withdrawal syndrome (WDS) from here out and not repeat sedative-hypnotic.

Several different systems of ranking WDS have been proposed over the years, the most famous of which is the Clinical Withdrawal – Alcohol- Scale (CWAS). The advantage of this over watching vital signs is that vital sign increases mean that autonomic dysregulation has already occurred. The CWAS concerns itself mostly with those symptoms that can presage vital sign dysregulation. This is important because the sooner WDS can be treated the better. Best yet is to treat preventively in advance of any symptom of WDS. This is especially true as seizure can be the first symptom. Most practitioners use their own primary symptoms (usually taken from the CWAS) as an informal rule of thumb in adjusting and titrating in WDS. Use what you are most comfortable with.

Medical withdrawal can be accomplished in both inpatient and outpatient locations depending on the needs of the patient. There is not going to be one correct way to do treatment for WDS. The treatment will and should change depending on the condition of the patient and the placement of treatment. Some treatments that would never be used in an outpatient setting may be the treatments of choice in an inpatient setting. The choice of setting and medication for treatment is based on a few different factors discussed below.

Basic Tenets:
The basic tenets of WDS management are to use a DIFFERENT, CROSS-TOLERANT agent of LONGER HALF-LIFE than the drug you’re withdrawing. So, there are three principles here: different drug, cross-tolerant drug, and longer half-life drug. The main reason to use a different drug, especially in an outpatient setting, is to decrease the chance for the tapering dose to trigger craving. A cross-tolerant agent must be used or there would be no effect at the GABA receptor, more about why that is important later when we discuss kindling. The reason to use the longer half-life medication is to give a smoother slope to the blood level decline for greater comfort and, therefore, adherence. The smoother slope also aids in preventing kindling.

Liking:
With inpatient medical withdrawal, the “liking” of a substance is of little concern as the patient is not the one administering the dose. In an outpatient setting, the issue of “drug liking” becomes paramount. To send an addicted patient home with a prescription for a medication with a high liking potential is a recipe for disaster. You will likely get a phone call that all the pills have been taken and he’s in worse straights than before.

Below is a liking ranking derived from “Relative abuse liability of different benzodiazepines in drug abusers” .

Table 8 - Sedative Hypnotic Liking
Drug	Liking Score
Tuinal	90
Secobarbital	85
Diazepam	80
Pentobarbital	75
Lorazepam	75
Alprazolam	70
Clorazepate	50
Clonazepam	45
Oxazepam	45
Chlordiazepoxide	35
Phenobarbital	28

Kindling:
It has been shown in the literature repeatedly that each time a person experiences WDS the chance of his having seizures during subsequent WDS events is increased. If we had a cure for addiction or could be sure that this was the last WDS event this patient would ever have, we might be able to ignore kindling. As we can never say that, preventing kindling becomes an important part of treating any WDS event and must be considered in choosing medications for treatment.

Enzyme induction:
Some medications used in treating WDS can induce enzyme systems that affect other medications. The need for other medical treatment can therefore complicate the decision about what medication to use for WDS. Enzyme induction is not a contra-indication for using a medication; it is merely something to be aware of.

Good taper:
The pharmacokinetics of a tapering medication, especially in the outpatient setting, when treating WDS is paramount. Sudden falls in coverage of the GABA receptor can lead to kindling and increased symptoms. When choosing a medication, we want to pick one that tapers gradually.

Monitoring:
In outpatient treatment another consideration is the monitoring of abstinence in the patient during the treatment. In the inpatient environment, with 24-hour observation and nurse administered medications, this is less of an issue, but in the outpatient arena patients’ abstinence is monitored. If this is done with simple screening tests, using any benzodiazepine will defeat monitoring for all others. Therefore, use of a benzodiazepine or phenobarbital will necessitate the use of confirmatory testing for monitoring and quick confirmatory testing will need to be available to make such use safe in the outpatient setting.

Here is a table of WDS treatment regimens with notation of how they do with each of these factors:

Table 9 - Pros and Cons of Methods of Sedative Hypnotic Withdrawal Management
Method	Basic Tenets	Kindling	Liking	Enzyme Induction	Good Taper	Covers Complicated WDS	Monitoring
Taper the Drug	-	+	-	+/-	-	-	-
Phenobarb substitution/taper	+	+	+	-	+	+	+/-
Valium Taper	+*	+	-	+	+	+	+/-
Serax Taper	+*	+	+	+	-	+	+/-
Clonazepam Taper	+*	+	+	+	+	+	+/-
AED Titration and Taper	+	+	+	-	+	-	+
Clonidine	-	-	+	+	+	-	+
*If this isn’t the drug that you’re withdrawing.

With these factors in mind, some of the basic methods listed here will be described.

Phenobarbital Challenge and Taper:
The challenge dose is determined from the chart below. This chart is derived from Smith and Wesson and is listed in the ASAM text .
 

Table 10 - Phenobarbital Equivalent Doses for Sedative Hypnotics
Medication	Dose Equivalent to 30mg of Phenobarbital
Ativan	2mg
Soma	700mg
Xanax	1-2mg
Valium	10mg
Beer	24 ounces
Pentobarbital	100mg
Librium	25mg
Clonazepam	2mg
Serax	10-15mg

First, one calculates the daily equivalent of phenobarbital and divides it into three doses. The first dose is given as a challenge. If the patient slurs his speech, has ataxia or falls asleep, the challenge dose is too large. If the challenge dose is not enough to affect symptoms, it can be repeated in 90 minutes. Once the dose is stabilized it can be decreased by 30mg a day every week. It is important to note that the dose is tapered by dose not by frequency, so, for instance, if you started with TID dosing you’d keep TID dosing but decrease each dose. You would not drop 30mg by going from 30mg TID to 30mg BID. If this taper is not tolerated, it can be slowed.

The phenobarbital challenge and taper is the classic paradigm and all other substitution/taper regimens will derive from that. When using a benzodiazepine for substitution and taper, one would look it up on the table above and then use that equivalent dose instead of 30mg phenobarbital for challenge and taper. For instance, if a patient presents having taken 1mg Xanax TID for 2 years and you choose to do a phenobarbital taper, you could start with a 30mg dose of phenobarbital as a challenge. If you were treating this patient in an inpatient setting and wanted to use Valium, you could use a 10mg challenge dose.

If one wanted to use an AED for challenge and taper both carbamazepine and valproate have good literature on their use. For carbamazepine one would use a 100mg challenge dose and dose 100-200mg TID. With valproate one would use a 250mg challenge dose and dose 250-500mg BID to TID. When using valproate care should be taken to be aware of the form of the medication. Long acting, non-generic formulations still exist, and one should know what form one is using. During AED taper, if there are breakthrough symptoms, phenobarbital can be added in single doses. In general AED treatment is for 4 weeks, but there are several papers suggesting that addicted patients often benefit from longer treatment.

Agents:
Diazepam – High liking score but a nice slow taper, good choice in an INPATIENT setting where medication is administered.

Oxazepam – Low liking but this positive is negated by the very sharp drop off in blood level at 6 hours. Internists love Serax because it doesn’t go through the liver, but this kinetic profile makes it useless at less than QID frequency. Even in a hospital with nursing administration, using oxazepam can give the patient 4 kindling events a day instead of none.

Clonazepam – Good long half-life and mid-range liking score gives clonazepam the edge at being the only benzodiazepine of any value in outpatient WDS. Even then it should only be used when someone other than the patient administers the medication; that means patients who live alone should not be going home with a prescription for clonazepam.

Carbamazepine –The only downside here is enzyme induction (a complication in a Suboxone patient) and med-med interaction. This is a good choice. Long-range considerations such as rash and blood anemia are almost never seen in the short-term treatment of outpatients for WDS. Liver tests before starting are a good idea, but they are a good idea in all patients starting treatment. There are a significant number of studies showing good effect in benzodiazepine withdrawal. , ,

Valproate – Same problems as carbamazepine but fewer side-affects as it’s a P450 inhibitor more than an inducer. Might be less well tolerated in woman who read about weight gain. Perhaps the best choice in a patient titrating on Suboxone at the same time.

Phenobarbital – It’s the classic. It has the downside of being a controlled substance and enzyme induction. Other than that, it is a great choice. The induction is of 2B6 and 3A4 which could complicate treatment of a patient starting buprenorphine which is metabolized by 3A4.

Adjuncts:
Beta-blockers or alpha-blockers (or alpha2 agonists) can be used in cases of vital sign dysregulation AFTER appropriate treatment as been started. They should never be used alone, and because their only use is in treatment started too late, they should be a rare addition in an outpatient setting. That is, if we’ve done our job correctly in the outpatient setting, the patient has no need of either class of anti-adrenergic medications in WDS. (Note: This statement applies to sedative hypnotic WDS; in opioid WDS clonidine may serve a useful role because opioid WDS does not present the same dangers)

Thiamine is important in anyone who has been drinking heavily. Oral supplementation of 100mg TID is recommended for the first week. There has been some controversy about this as the recommended allowance is for 100mg a day; why take that amount TID? Thiamine is easily washed out as a water-soluble B vitamin. Giving 100mg a day to someone who is rehydrating after heavy drinking usually doesn’t get that person the full benefit of 100mg; that’s why the suggestion is to over prescribe Thiamine for the first week.

Choosing the best method in a Townsend clinic:
Townsend should adhere to the basic tenets of treatment of WDS. This would rule out any treatment that violated a basic tenet including tapering the drug of use and mono-therapy with an adrenergic blocker. As an outpatient treatment program, Townsend should not use treatments with medications with high liking scores or poor pharmacokinetics such as Valium taper or Serax taper. Given that we do Medical Monitoring for Adherence rather than just screening, monitoring is only a minor factor but using a benzodiazepine can still complicate the picture in the case of a complicated patient. This leaves us with Phenobarbital and the AEDs to use for challenge and taper. Phenobarbital is still a monitoring challenge though barbiturates are abused less frequently than benzodiazepines, so it is less of a problem. AED or Phenobarbital titration and taper seem the best fit. If the Townsend doctor feels he/she should use some other method of treatment of WDS he/she should get consultation from the clinic medical director or the CMO.
