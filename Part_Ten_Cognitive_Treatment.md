### Why Therapy Doesn’t Work for Addiction

Therapy fixes things. Something’s wrong, you go to therapy, you get it fixed,
and you graduate. Congratulations, you’re well. It works great for neurotics.

The problem is that addicts aren’t neurotics and addiction isn’t neurosis. You
can go to therapy, figure out why you have addiction, change the thing that
caused you to have addiction, graduate, and go out and get drunk that day.
Addiction doesn’t go away, and you can’t fix it; you have to learn to live with
it. Trying to fix addiction with therapy is like trying to treat blindness with
therapy. You may know why you’re blind, but you’ll still be blind.

Since addiction can’t be fixed, what’s the goal of the cognitive part of
treatment? It is to learn to live with the condition and still be happy without
using. I read a study recently that tells us exactly why therapy won’t work and
teaching someone to live with the condition will.

Loran Nordgren at Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management and his
colleagues included 4 studies in paper. The central theme of this paper,
restraint bias, is that people’s inflated sense of self-restraint will actually
put them at greater risk of impulsive behavior because they’ll be more likely to
go into risky situations.

What I like about this paper is that it presents a simple central idea and then
tests it, not with one experiment, but a robust suite of studies that look at it
from different angles. They base the idea of restraint bias on earlier work on
something called the “empathy gap.” The empathy gap is not about empathy towards
others; it’s the difference in feeling someone has in a “hot” state such as
craving and a “cold” state when they can no longer remember how it felt to be in
the hot state. It’s basically a lack of empathy with you in a former state. As
old as this idea is (1996), Alcoholics Anonymous discussed it even earlier, “We
are unable at certain times to bring into our consciousness with sufficient
force the memory of the suffering and humiliation of even a week or a month ago.
We are without defense against the first drink.”

From the idea of the empathy gap, Nordgren and his colleagues supposed that in a
“cold” state people will take more risks and be more likely to be impulsive
because they don’t have an empathy with the “hot” state and will overestimate their
ability to refrain from action. You may wonder why business school researchers
are interested in this, but think of the fact that mechanical stock traders who
follow rules generally do better than those that go by their “gut.” The most
successful stock traders I have heard of are the ones that know that their own
brain is their worst enemy.  So Nordgren’s work isn’t just applicable to people
with addiction, the restraint bias is a universal human phenomenon. But for
people with addiction, it’s particularly dangerous, because to take the first
drink or drug or bite or bet can be catastrophic.

Their first study had to do with students and their study habits when tired.
The second had to do with snack choices when hungry. The third and fourth
studies looked at smokers, and we’ll concentrate there.

In their third study, they split the group into those who believed they had high
self-control over smoking and those with a belief that they had low self-
control. They then asked both groups to, without smoking a cigarette, watch a
movie that would cue them to smoke. The kicker is that people would get a
monetary reward for not smoking during the film, and they got to choose the
reward in advance. If they left their cigarettes in another room during the
film, they could win 2€. If they left their cigarettes on the desk in the
cubicle they could win 4€. Holding it in their hand throughout the film got them
6€, or holding it unlit in their mouth would get them 8€. As predicted smokers
in the high control group exposed themselves to more risk than did the low
control group. In the high control group, which took greater risks, 33% of the
subjects smoked, while in the low control group taking less risk, it was only
11%.

The fourth study also had to do with smokers, in this case, smokers who had quit
and were past nicotine withdrawal. Again they self divided into those that
believed they had good control and those who thought they had a lower level of
control. Four months later when they were followed up. As expected, smokers who
felt they had high control reported less avoidance of cigarettes, and a greater
percentage of those that had less avoidance of cigarettes relapsed.

In their discussion they refer to a recent study of heroin addicts who are asked
what price they would pay for a buprenorphine pill. The study found that people
with addiction in withdrawal would value it more highly than those not in
withdrawal. While that might seem like common sense, the authors point out that
all of the subjects not in withdrawal had been in withdrawal before and knew it
was likely that they’d be in withdrawal again, but because they were in a “cold”
state, they just couldn’t remember how bad that would be.

So why did I start this off about therapy? It has to do with what therapists are
taught. We are taught that self-efficacy is critical to self-control. We are
taught that people should be empowered to achieve what they want to achieve.
This has always been at odds with AA’s insistence on powerlessness as the path
to recovery. What Nordgren’s work shows is that, for addiction anyway, those
that embrace the fact of their powerlessness will be more likely to not use and
more likely to stay in recovery. It’s always been my experience, and it’s always
a point of contention when I’m discussing patients with colleagues who treat a
more general population than addiction. This may also be akin to the Stockdale
Paradox as described by Collins.  Efficacy can be achieved more fully when one
tries not to have efficacy over what one cannot control.

Now we have behavioral scientists agreeing with what AA and other 12-step
programs have said for 70 years. Perhaps this is why there is no psychological
treatment for addiction that has been shown to work any better than 12-step
facilitation treatment where the patient is encouraged to get into 12-step
recovery. Perhaps going to meetings reminds us of that “hot” state without
getting into it because while we can’t empathize with our former selves, we can
perhaps empathize with the person sitting next to us now.

 
### ADAM Disease Acceptance Model

When the first treatment program to use ADAM started, there was no innovative
model for incorporating the science of addiction into mainline addiction
treatment. Or rather, there was no model of mainline addiction treatment that
could allow in the science. Since no program existed, we needed to make one
ourselves. It started with the understanding that addiction is a chronic
illness, just like any other chronic illness such as diabetes or hypertension.
We looked at the goals of treatment for other chronic diseases and came to see
that medical stabilization was the key to moving forward. The methodology for
midbrain stabilization is described elsewhere and won’t be repeated here.

After medical stabilization, the symptoms of addiction are suppressed enough so
that the patient can sit in the group and get the work of treatment done. This
allows the cognitive changes that a person needs to make in order to accept
their chronic condition. These are the same regardless of the chronic illness.
The cognitions are (specifically modified for addiction):

- I have a problem
- The problem is a brain illness called addiction
- The illness is chronic and progressive
- I cannot make myself symptom free
- There are no vacations from this recovery

Knowing that these cognitions are the goals of treatment gives us a big leg up,
but ideas are not enough. People have to make a commitment to the idea, to take
it into themselves. It’s not enough to make a decision and say, “I believe this.”
One has to make a commitment and act on it. So these cognitions aren’t just
thoughts, they are actions, and we know from the work of others throughout
history how actions are taken.

First, there is no thought of taking the action, so we’ll call that stage
“Pre-thought.” Then one begins the process of thinking about taking the action,
so we’ll call that stage “Thinking.” After people have thought about taking an
action they either do it or are stuck by something that stops them. What stops
them is usually some external barrier, whether it’s been later internalized or
not, so we’ll call the next stage “Barrier.” And finally, once they are past any
barriers, they make a commitment, so the final stage is called “Commitment.”

So we can list our 5 cognitions on separate lines and then make 4 columns for
the stages people go through. That grid gives us the Townsend Disease Acceptance
Scale (DAS). The DAS is a 20 square grid on which we can map a new patient’s
cognitive status and progress in treatment. We can also use it to analyze why a
patient is not moving through the program as fast as we think he should. But how
will you know what stage of change each patient has achieved with each
cognition? We have developed a chart of the same 20 squares populated with some
examples of what would evidence that a patient is at a certain level of change.
Let’s start with that.


Table 13 - Disease Acceptance Scale - As Evidenced By

|Cognition | Pre-thought | Thinking | Barrier |	Commitment
|--------|---------------|----------|----------|--------|
|I have a problem |	Patient's statements evidence that he takes no responsibility for his own behavior | Patient's statements evidence that he is considering that his behaviors may cause his problems | Patient’s statements and actions evidence that only an external barrier prevents him from accepting that the problem lies in him | The patient has accepted that the problem is within him |
|It’s a brain illness |	Patient continues to blame drugs or a particular drug for life events and consequences and believes he can continue some expressions of addiction if he stops others | Patient's statements evidence his questioning whether his problem is an illness rather than a drug or social problem | Patient seems to know that he has addiction but there are seemingly external barriers to full acceptance of the fact | Patient’s speech and action evidence that he accepts that he has a brain illness called addiction which is not limited to any specific drug or reward |
| It’s chronic and progressive | Patient speaks of addiction in the past tense and makes plans inconsistent with a progressive chronic illness | Patient states that his illness may never go away	| Patient identifies characteristics of his disease that show the progressive and chronic nature of the illness | Patient has accepted that there is no cure but rather he requires ongoing recovery |
| I cannot make myself symptom free	| Patient states plans for the future that are self driven and rely on only himself for success	| Patient states that maybe he can't do this by himself	| Patient states that he/she needs others but has taken no action because of barrier | Patient spontaneously refers to external support networks |
| There are no vacations from this recovery	| Patient speaks of a time when he will not need help or of taking time off from recovery	| Patient states that maybe he will need help/recovery without interruption	| Patient identifies characteristics of recovery that are lifelong in nature	| Patient has altered his daily life to reflect those characteristics of recovery |

Well that’s fine as far as it goes, but it’s easy to say “Patient identifies
characteristics of his disease that show the progressive and chronic nature of
the illness.” How do you know he identifies these characteristics? Here’s our
chart again, this time with examples of what the patient might say at each stage.


Table 14 - Disease Acceptance Scale - Examples
Cognition

|Pre-thought |	Thinking |	Barrier	| Commitment |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------|
|I have a problem |	“X sent me”
“I want to keep my (job, family, etc.)”
“I want to stay out of jail” |	“Yeah, but…”
“All I did was…”
“It really wasn’t my fault, because…” |	“I screwed up”
“How do I change?”
“I have to change” |	As measured in the “as evidenced by” chart above |
|It’s a brain illness |	“I’ve just got to stop drinking and everything will be okay”
“I’m not sick, I don’t need a doctor”
“I’ll stop drinking, but you can’t ask me to stop smoking” |	“What proof is there that I’m sick?”
“I do ____ more when I ____”
“How come I’m ___ing more now that I’ve quit ___” |	“But my family/employer won’t understand this”
“But I can’t stop everything”
“One addiction at a time” |	“It really doesn’t matter what it is; it’s my brain with the disease”
“Well that must release some dopamine in my brain” |
|It’s chronic and progressive |	“When I’m over this addiction…”
“How long do I have to do this?”
“When can I drink again?” |	“You mean this isn’t going away?”
“Is anyone ever cured?”
“It went away before, won’t it again?”	| “How can I live like that?”
“What will it be like?”
“Won’t it be boring?” |	“It’s okay that this isn’t going away because I have a program”
“I really only have to do this one day at a time” |
| I cannot make myself symptom free	| “All I have to do is join a gym”
“I just have to get out of this town”
“What if I just think positive?” |	“I still want to use even though I’m working out”
“You know when I talk to you I feel better”
“Maybe I should do something else” |	“How can I call people when I’m at work?”
“I hate to bother people”
“What should I do?”	| “I was mad at the boss so I called my sponsor”
“I couldn’t sleep so I made an appointment with the doctor” |
| There are no vacations from this recovery	| “It’s only a week”
“I’ll call if I think I’m getting in trouble” |
“I’ll talk to my wife instead”	“I’ll try to call every day”
“Bobby did it and he didn’t relapse”
“Maybe I can and maybe I can’t”	| “What if I get tired of recovery?”
“What if nobody answers?” |	“I’ll bring my cell phone”
“I’ll go to the bathroom and make a call” |

So we have a way to see where a patient is on each of the cognitions. That still leaves knowing what to do about it. We’ve again annotated the same chart below but this time we’ve put in some general strategies for moving the patient from one stage of change to the next.
 
Table 15 - Disease Acceptance Scale - Interventional Strategies
Cognition	Pre-thought	Thinking	Barrier	Commitment
I have a problem	Identify problems and probe who the patient thinks is responsible	Examining with the patient the possible outcomes of behaving differently	Build hope and educate on techniques of sustained behavioral change
It’s a brain illness	Patient is asked about symptoms and their consequences in his life	Psycho-education on the neurobiology of addiction	Patient is educated on techniques of self care for his illness
It’s chronic and progressive	Patient reviews previously created lists to notate the duration of these problems	Explore with the patient whether  he/she has ever had control of his symptoms	Instill hope that he/she can live symptom free and educating the patient on how he/she can recruit the people he/she needs
I cannot make myself symptom free	Explore with the patient his plans for maintaining recovery in the future	Explore remaining need to manage future symptoms alone	Develop solutions to the previously identified resistances
There are no vacations from this recovery	Reemphasize the chronic and progressive nature of the disease	Foster his ambivalence about his ability to take time off from his recovery	Assist patient with techniques to remain focused on today

Notice that there is nothing written under Commitment on this sheet. That’s because the Commitment stage is the goal of this cognitive change. Of course one might argue that maintaining the commitment is the goal and that would be correct, but maintenance should be a natural consequence of the cognitive change brought about by the move to action and aided by monitoring.
Still, these are only vague general ideas of how we will intervene at each of these stages. It might be helpful to have some specific interventions prepared for each stage as well. We have developed a PowerPoint slide show of several. You’ll all develop your own as time goes by or already have some you use. Now that we have this system in place you’ll be able to share yours with your colleagues and they will share with you. That will make us all richer in knowledge. There are interventions to use in an individual session as well as a group session. Also there are interventions that are homework assignments. Just to get us started here’s a re-annotation of the chart again, this time with specific homework assignments filled in.
 
Table 16 - Disease Acceptance Scale - Specific Homework Assignment Examples
Cognition	Pre-thought	Thinking	Barrier	Commitment

I have a problem	Patient writes a list of problems in his/her current or past life and documents a time line for causality for them all	Patient reviews time line again adding what he/she imagines would have happened had he/she acted differently	Assign for reading a passage to be determined and have the patient document included tools for change
It’s a brain illness	Patient list the symptoms of addiction and documents all reward behaviors he's used in response	Patient annotates a neurobiological diagram of addiction with his reward behaviors	Patient is asked to re-annotate the diagram with the tools of recovery
It’s chronic and progressive	Patient is asked to create a timeline of his symptoms and when reward behaviors started	Patient re-annotates his timeline where he/she thinks he/she had control of his symptoms	Patient creates a document listing his symptoms and sources of help
I cannot make myself symptom free	Patient re-annotates his timeline with times he/she tried symptom management alone	Annotates his help source list with reasons he/she feels it won't work	Present to group for comment and solution his list of resistances
There are no vacations from this recovery	Patient will re-annotate his time line to reflect places where he/she did or thinks he/she could have taken a vacation from recovery	Patient reviews written material on chronic diseases and note the risks for chronic illness patients taking a vacation from care	Patient creates a list of self care behaviors that he/she can use each day including meditation and health hygiene

 
Again, we have no specific assignments for the patient in the Commitment stage. Of course there is a lot of wisdom in our group of clinicians about how to intervene at various points in this model. As time passes we’ll have a chart of suggested group interventions, individual session interventions, family interventions, etc. The TCM gives us a framework on which we can base the growth of our collective talent in helping people learn to live with the chronic illness of addiction.
