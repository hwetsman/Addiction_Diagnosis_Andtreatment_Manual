<center><h1>Forward</h1></center>

Long before the APA’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM)[^1], long before America forgot that addiction is a disease, long before
ASAM, long before prohibition and AA, there was a specialty of Addiction
Medicine. Physicians who were well respected practiced it; it had its own
journal[^2]. Treatment centers were set up to treat the illness[^3].

These physicians didn’t have the resources or the science we have today, but
they had something we didn’t. They had a blank canvas, unmarred by preconceived
ideas. They had their observations and they didn’t have to edit those to match
what was expected by the academic powers that be. They watched the illness in
its natural form, and they respected its power. They didn’t try to pretend it
was something less than it was, an act of nature.

They took their observations and devised treatments based on those. Unlike most
of today’s addiction specialists they did not have a primary mental health
background, perhaps because there was not much in the way of organized
psychiatry yet. So their observations and their treatments were aimed at a
physical illness called by several names such as Addiction, Alcoholism, and
Inebriety. But by whatever name they called it, they did not use the name to
pretend that the thing had no power. They saw it as physical illness.

The social change that occurred in America in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries led to a different view of addiction. A discussion of the
anthropology and sociology of how that change came about is interesting but is
beyond the scope of this book. Suffice it to say that by 1920, America, and A
ddiction Medicine, was entirely different.

No longer was addiction an illness that occurred in nature; it was the
consequence of willful behavior. No longer was treatment seen as necessary;
what was necessary was a moral change. No longer could a physician use
medication, beyond withdrawal medications, to help a patient. As addiction was
no longer an illness, the AMA stated that the treatment of the person with
addiction was no longer within the purview of the physician. The laws changed.
Expectations changed. Generations of physicians came and went having never
learned the knowledge of their distant predecessors.

But since that time we have had the reintroduction of Addiction Medicine, the
formation of ASAM and now board certification. We’ve had Olds and Milner[^4];
we’ve had DiChiara[^5]. We’ve had the “Decade of the Brain[^6].” We’ve had
multiple new medications introduced to help people with addiction. We’ve had
the Human Genome Project[^7]. We know more about the neurobiology of addiction
than we do any other behavioral brain based disorder.

Still, more important than what we’ve gained is, I think, what we’ve lost.
We’ve lost our last excuse to not treat addicted people like patients with a
chronic incurable biological illness.

We know what those doctors in the nineteenth century could not have known. We
have the tools they could not have had. We have a wealthier country than they
could know. We have greater ability to communicate with each other and our
patients than they could have imagined.

We have a more heterogeneous society than that of the early twentieth century.
We don’t have as many of the social prejudices that then existed. We don’t have
the proprietary blinders they were proud of.

So unlike the physicians of the nineteenth or early twentieth centuries, we
have no excuse. There is no longer any reason for any person to die of addiction.
It is a treatable chronic illness, though while left untreated it is progressive
and fatal. Every death from addiction can be laid now at the feet of those who
would cling to the ignorance of the past, be they patient, family, doctor,
organization or society. The hope of this book is that, soon, there will be no
more unwilling sacrifices lying at those feet. And hopefully you will be part
of the revolution that brings that about.


<center><h1>Philosophy</center></h1>

The ADAM Way predates ADAM. I've been using the methods described here for
over twenty years. Everything in this book stems from the underlying idea that
addiction is an illness that exists in nature as opposed to a set of choices
created by man. It is an underlying worldview quite contradictory to that in
DSM. As DSM is the dominant model of all psychiatric illness, some explanation
is in order.

The DSM model is supposed to be atheoretical, however, the criteria evidence an
underlying worldview of what addiction is. In DSM one diagnoses substance use
disorder based on behavioral criteria. If you have enough behavioral criteria,
you have a substance disorder; if you do not, you don't. These criteria are also
applicable to remission of the illness, so that, regardless of what substances
the patient is still using, if they don't exhibit the substance related behavior,
they don't meet criteria for active illness. That makes it possible to still
drink and yet be in full, sustained remission from Severe Alcohol Use Disorder,
something that no addiction specialist I know would say. Also, the DSM criteria
have been limited to substances; until DSM5’s inclusion of gambling disorder,
there could be no addiction without substances. This inclusion seems to be secondary
to a great deal of political pressure rather than an acceptance of addiction as
a primary illness.

So the worldview put forth by DSM is that people are well; they begin to behave
in a certain way with respect to a substance (or gambling), they then abuse that
substance, and then become dependent. When they stop, the dependence is in remission
and all continuing symptoms must be explained by some other diagnosis. This has
given rise to a huge "dual diagnosis" industry. The DSM model has also spawned
many medical interventions for addiction, most based on blocking the rewarding
effects of substances, which should, theoretically, stop drug-using behavior.

My experience was at odds with DSM. My patients told me that they were not normal
before they used their first substance. They told me that there were many
behaviors that they tried, which worked, before they tried drugs, and that they
only escalated when the first behavior or drug stopped working.  They told me that
"blocking" medications made them sometimes feel worse and increased their desire
to use something else that worked. They showed me that the brain calculated something
common in addiction that was not specific to any substance or behavior. They showed
me I needed to learn more.

Further study showed me that the work of Di Chiara et al in 1988 was the first step in
understanding addiction as a single illness regardless of drug or behavior used.
Of note, the DSM behavioral worldview still in use today was first published in 1981,
before any of this science was done. More study elucidated for me the neurobiology
behind this natural illness and highlighted the highly genetic nature of it. Over
time I came to see that people with addiction, largely, were not normal to begin with,
but rather had an illness that caused symptoms that the substance use relieved. So the
DSM worldview has it that people use drugs, which then cause symptoms, and continued
use causes damage. Whereas I was seeing a picture where people had an illness that
caused symptoms and the symptoms drove them to use substances. This view was outside
the mainstream until 2011 when ASAM[^8] published its new definition of addiction.
But long before ASAM joined the party, the ADAM way was using the worldview of
their definition.

So, the ADAM Way is based on the worldview that addiction exists in nature
largely independent of substances or compulsive behavior, that it is largely
genetic, and that a well-defined neurobiology explains all its core phenomena
and epiphenomena. Everything at Townsend is based on this worldview and the
biological model that explains it. All the tools we've developed and use daily
come from this understanding. That understanding was helpful but couldn't take
us far without the tools we've developed to take advantage of it. Accordingly,
the tools, while useful, are not functional without the understanding. Both
theory and practical tools must come together for success. An example of this
is medication for addiction.

The DSM model leads to using a single medication depending on which substance
the person is using, and this is the main thrust of all drug company research
and FDA approval in the area. So we get acamprosate for people with addiction
who use alcohol and buprenorphine for people with addiction who use opioids.
The ADAM method is to understand at a deep level the various points in the
neurobiology, and not just to target each with a specific medication, but also
to do so in the correct order. Medical treatment for addiction will never work
with a cookie cutter approach; each patient's treatment must be tailored to that
patient, much like any other chronic illness.

Hopefully, this section has laid the groundwork for understanding why the
following sections are what they are. After one more section on the revolution
taking place in Addiction Medicine, I will explain the neurobiology as currently
understood, the medical interventions possible, and the tools available to use
those methods. I hope you'll find the Townsend Way valuable in your treatment of
addiction.


<center><h1>Revolutionizing Addiction Treatment</h1></center>

“It’s a revolution dammit! We’re going to have to offend somebody.” – The
character of John Adams, 1776 (movie)

There’s a lot right about the current situation in addiction treatment, but like
any system that’s been around awhile, there’s a lot wrong as well[^9]. Everyone from
Congress to HBO is starting to recognize addiction as a disease, but the bulk of
current addiction professionals, while they use the word disease, do not act as if
they are treating one.

To see what I mean, let’s look at the language the field uses. My colleague in
New York, Ed Salsitz, has been on the bandwagon to clean up our verbiage for a
long time. In his talks he shows a picture of a full urine cup with dirt poured
over it, “Now that’s a dirty urine.” His point is that patients don’t have
“dirty urine” any more than a diabetic patient who has glucose in his urine has
“dirty urine.” What they both have is a medical test positive for a certain
result. Using the term “dirty” adds an element of judgment that we would never
use in any other medical illness.

Here’s another one, “detox.” What a crazy word to use in the context of
addiction. The original medical meaning of detoxification is “a metabolic
process by which the body rids itself of toxic chemicals.” The way the
addiction treatment field uses the word started only in the 1970s: to get
someone off of intoxicating substances. We aren’t “detoxing” anyone. The “toxin”
is already gone. What we’re doing is medically managing the withdrawal symptoms
caused by the abrupt cessation of the toxin. Ed’s point is that by using
“street” language rather than medical language, the addiction treatment field
is holding itself back from professionalism and professional recognition.

Here’s one Ed doesn’t mention but that I think is silly, “aftercare.” It
suggests just what is meant, that the person doing the treatment believes
that the “care” is over and that this is a period after care. It’s not; it’s
continuing care. The illness of addiction is chronic through the life span, why
should care end for addiction any more than it should end for diabetes or high
blood pressure. But most people treating addiction today are not medical
professionals and many are not even counseling professionals, and the field has
hijacked some medical terminology that suggests meanings that aren’t inherent
in current practice. In fact, it is current practice to believe that a period of
inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment is a complete treatment and that the
care has been given. That comes from the current practice of focusing on
inpatient treatment facilities that often need to take people from many miles
away because of the expense of treatment. Could you imagine treating diabetes
like that? Go off to Atlanta to get your diabetes regulated with insulin, then,
now that you’re treated, go back home and get after care usually not including
insulin. No wonder treatment has such high relapse rates.

That brings me to the revolution. If addiction were a chronic medical condition
that is now being treated with acute treatment and aftercare, what would happen
if we did it differently? Diabetes is often suggested as a model of a chronic
disease like addiction: chronic, progressive, incurable, and fatal if untreated.
They have similar rates of non-adherence to the plan of care (50-70%) and both
involve medication treatment along with lifestyle changes[^10]. When the state of
North Carolina started treating its diabetic Medicaid patients with a chronic
disease management model the relapse (return to uncontrolled glucose) rate fell
from 55 to 33%[^11]. And they didn’t include any treatment for alcoholism or
compulsive overeating, two expressions of addiction that lead to diabetic
relapse.

To understand how we can use chronic disease management in addiction we’re going
to have to define the word relapse. Currently it is used in the addiction field,
like so many other medical terms, in a non-medical way. In every other branch of
medicine relapse means return of symptoms after symptom suppression. In
addiction what is meant is lack of adherence to the care plan. In diabetes the
care plan includes not eating cake but eating cake is not a relapse; it is a
lack of adherence to the care plan. In addiction the care plan includes not
using drugs or compulsive behaviors, but it’s called relapse as if the drug use
was the symptom of the illness. The symptom of addiction is not drug use; it is
the symptoms that cause drug use.

What are the symptoms of addiction? All drugs of abuse (including behaviors that
can be expressions of addiction) cause a temporary increased dopamine tone in
the brain’s reward system. Lowered tone of dopamine in the reward system has a
specific set of symptoms that precede drug use: relative anhedonia, poor
attention, irritability, inability to attach to others, and more. The brain
with addiction remembers that those symptoms can be alleviated for a brief spell
with the use of a reward; of course, it’s going to want to go get it. Let’s
look at how our thinking would change if we looked at symptoms in relation to
relapse rather than lack of adherence to care plan?

One thing that would happen is that problems would be found sooner when they are
more manageable. Instead of finding out that Johnny has problems when his
monitoring urine test comes back positive, we hear about it a month earlier
while screening for the primary symptoms by phone or during continuing care
meetings. Another thing that happens is that it gives us the cause to treat
rather than the result. How successful should it be to treat the result of an
illness (drug use) rather than the cause (symptoms)? I don’t think any doctor
would have much of a success rate with putting a pneumonia patient in an ice
water bath to reduce their fever. I can envision quite a few funerals and
malpractice suits with that one. Instead of trying to stop drug use (like
merely giving an opioid dependent patient an opioid blocker) we’d give medicines
that relieved the symptoms so that the patient’s brain wouldn’t tell him to go
get opiates.

Think about what such a program would look like. Patients would come in for a
specific program of stabilization and intensive treatment to prepare them for
lifelong chronic disease management and then transfer to continuing care with
appropriate monitoring and continuing education and support. The barriers to
getting to care, should problems arise, will decrease and “relapses” will be
handled much earlier with fewer complications lowering total costs to insurers
and society.

So, who will be offended? Well, it’s going to be somebody, but it won’t be the
patients, insurers or society in general. The only people offended will be those
dogmatic believers in the “we always did it that way” approach. But, then again,
that’s who gets offended in every revolution.
