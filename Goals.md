<center><h2>Goals of Addiction Medicine the Townsend Way</h2></center>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The first goal of an Addiction Medicine specialist working in a treatment center
will be to stabilize midbrain dopamine tone to promote rapid response to
treatment.

Once the midbrain is stabilized the goal is to move the patient from active
addiction to full voluntary recovery via a repeated process of small cognitive
changes, meeting the patient where he or she is at all times.

This process should be monitored with quantifiable neurocognitive testing so that
team and patient can have a common reference point for mapping the process.

The Addiction Medicine physician must remember that he or she is treating a
chronic progressive illness, and that the point of treatment is to keep the
patient alive long enough to die of something else.
